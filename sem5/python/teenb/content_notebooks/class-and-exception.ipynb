    "# Classes and Objects\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint by which you can define custom variables or objects\n",
    "- These objects can have multiple variables which are known as members\n",
    "- They can also have multiple functions which they can perform, known as methods\n",
    "# Class vs Object with Analogy\n",
    "- A class is like the blueprint for a car\n",
    "- The actual car that is constructed from the blueprint is the object or instance of that class\n",
    "# `self` in Classes\n",
    "- `self` is the pointer to the object which is calling the methods defined in the class\n",
    "- Think of `self` as a way to say \"this particular object.\"\n",
    "- `self` is important as the when a object method is called, self is used to identify which object called the method\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    - If `Jash` and `Param` are two objects of the `Person` class\n",
    "    - `Jash` object calls a method `say_name()`\n",
    "    - The program knows that `Jash` calls the method `say_name()` because of `self` and prints \"My name is Jash\" instead of \"My name is Param\"\n",
    "    - Otherwise the program wouldn't know who called the method and would be confused\n",
    "# Methods\n",
    "- Methods are functions that can be executed by an object of that class\n",
    "- They are defined inside the class\n",
    "- All methods (except Constructor) must have atleast one argument which is `self`\n",
    "# Constructors\n",
    "- Each class has a constructor\n",
    "- Use the constructor to define the members of the class\n",
    "- All constructors must be named `__init__`\n",
    "# Destructors\n",
    "- Having a destructor is optional as python has automatic memory management\n",
    "- The destructor is used to define the behaviour of the object when it is destroyed\n",
    "- It is useful in cases where the object:\n",
    "    - Handles external resources like files or network connections, you might need to ensure these are properly closed when the object is no longer needed\n",
    "    - Needs to perform certain actions (like saving data or logging) right before an object is destroyed\n",
